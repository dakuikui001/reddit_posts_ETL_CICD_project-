As a result, her family had to eat instant noodles as their final meal of 2025. # Food ordered at night The woman, Lim, told *Mothership* that she had placed the order at 7:41pm on Dec. 31, 2025 and received her order at 3:40am on Jan. 1, 2026. Due to the delay, the food arrived past the safe consumption period, she said, and was allegedly unrefrigerated for hours, resulting in it going bad. Lims attempts to contact foodpandas customer service to request for a refund were also rejected and she was informed that her case would be recorded as feedback. # Ordered S$73.70 worth of food, paid extra S$1.50 priority delivery fee Lim, a pandapro member, ordered four dishes and rice from Lao Huo Tang Signature at Tampines Mall. The total cost of her meal was S$73.70 - S$71.60 for the food items, S$1.99 for the delivery fee, which was waved due to her membership, a priority delivery fee of S$1.50 and a platform fee of S$0.60. When she successfully made the order at 7:41pm, the estimated delivery time was 45 to 50 minutes. However, upon checking the app subsequently for the expected arrival time, she found that it had changed to 50 to 65 minutes without explanation and there was no option to cancel the order. Food picked up hours later At around 3:20am, Lim received a notification that her order was being picked up. The delivery rider called and spoke to her, and mentioned how he had found it strange to have received an order placed at 7:41pm. When probed, the delivery rider stated that the restaurant was already closed and he had to collect the food from outside the restaurant. The food was eventually delivered at around 3:40am. Lim said she had already fallen asleep by then. She subsequently woke up and found the food at her doorstop at around 11am. As it was not consumable, she did not take pictures of her order and threw the food away. # Attempted to contact foodpanda to no avail Lim attempted to contact foodpandas customer support on multiple occasions. On Jan. 1, the request for a refund was rejected as customer support stated that Lim could not prove the food was spoilt through smell alone. On Jan. 2, Lim sent in another request, but was rejected once more. The next day she contacted customer support again, but was told that the issue would just be reported to the concerned team to help prevent this issue from occurring again. During her last interaction with customer support, Lim explicitly asked if she was speaking to a bot or a live agent. The reply was that they were a live agent. Lim said she understood that New Years Eve is a predictable peak period, but the platform should have the discretion to limit orders. She said: If a platform cannot fulfil orders within a safe timeframe, perhaps it should limit orders, suspend priority delivery options, or provide clearer warnings, instead of completing deliveries hours later with no resolution for affected customers. *Mothership* has reached out to foodpanda for comment.",2026-01-12 00:00:03.729106

Ambulance came n recommended going to hospital. So the A&E doc says to stay in hospital KTPH for investigation and monitoring given her age, almost 70. So at that point, we were asked which ward. As she has an IP plan NTUC Income plan B, and the amounts shown to us was that after insurance, and medisave of 2k, we just needed a cash guarantee of $100+ if we went for B1. And we were told that should the cash deposit not be enough, they would inform us during the stay. So we went with B1. So came the bill in the mail which was abt 5k for 3days (close to the amt which was shown to us during the admission. In the end, medishield and IP combined only paid $450. We had to pay almost 90% cos of deductible (2.5K) n claim limits (3k). Got to wonder the usefulness of the IP and the information shown to us during admission. Would gone for B2 if we knew that we would be paying 90% of bill in B1 She had previous operations in the same hospital, n we didnt have to pay so much. Pretty much cos this stay involved investigations/tests by the hospital while previous bill had a surgery component to cover So it seems if ur hospital stay is unplanned, better go for B2 else you might have to foot a huge part of your bil",2026-01-12 00:00:03.729581

The specific consequences for accumulating 5 demerit points in the HCI High School section are outlined in their student handbook: Sabbaticals: Students with 5 or more demerit points per term are recommended to attend corrective work order during the sabbatical week. Awards and Programs: Students are generally not recommended for school-based or external awards (e.g., Model Student Award, Edusave Character Award) and may be deprived of entry into or participation in special programmes, such as overseas trips or sponsorships for competitions.

Fought a fire demon in live shows and illustrations. Captain V: SPFs crime fighting character who debuted when a bus smashed through a wall (kind of like Kool-Aid Man in the US) while carrying a cardboard cutout in his likeness. Also had a comic. Titoy and Morchoo: Mascots of Gardenasia, a nature resort/farmstay villa thats super ulu (a YT video by one of those walking guides showed there was only 1 bus stop serving it), mostly their kids programs. How did POSBs smiley squirrel get their number for that mascot reunion back in 2019 I wish I knew. Keep SG Clean Supermons: Essentially, kind of our take on the tsukumogami (object spirits) from Japan. Owned by the public hygiene council and apparently are friends with captain green. Mr. Mandarin Starter: Oddly only lasted one year (1986) compared to Singa, Teamy and Sharity who im pretty sure never disappeared throughout their campaigns run in the 80s. Hes also my least favourite of this bunch. Suzy: The cerebral palsy donation box girl you used to see outside ntuc before she moved online as we went cashless. Also existed in south africa. Singas family: Lasted only 1 year as the national courtesy campaign was family centric 1987. That role now falls on Families for Life and their Becky Bunny. Puffy and Poofy: Puffy is the small one, Poofy is the big one. They are the mascots of Mascot Enterprise, who make mascot costumes. SuperBun: A female bread hero whos the mascot of Food From the Heart. She likes kaya and hates food waste. Timeli: National Punctuality Drive mascot. Was revealed by Pres. Wee Kim Wee alongside his event. NTUC Cereal Mascots: I didnt know they existed until recently. Maybe I shouldnt have wished I wish we had SG ver of Tony the Tiger",2026-01-12 00:00:03.730354

The line served as a trial for a planned line that would run from Kranji to Singapore colonial town. The planned line would begin at a station near Kadang Kerbau (present-day Tekka Centre), which would provide a connection with the existing steam tram network, and run along Bukit Timah Road to Scotts Road. A 6-mile strip of land on Bukit Timah Road was even reserved to be used for the tracks. The line would then run for another 6 miles just off the road towards Kranji. There would be 5 stations, including the Kadang Kerbau and Kranji termini. Plans to complete this line were scrapped. The similar but steam-powered Singapore–Kranji Railway opened a decade later on 1 January 1903, originally terminating at Tank Road station, where Exit B of Fort Canning MRT station is today. The line was then rerouted to terminate at Tanjong Pagar station on 3 May 1932, until its closure on 1 July 2011. Source: [*Singapore : a history of its trams, trolleybuses & buses.

Singapore: The Resilience Model Despite having a highly digitalised economy, Singapores labor market has remained stable. The key difference is a shift in hiring strategy: * **From Builders to Integrators:** Demand has shifted from Deep AI engineers (who build models) to AI Integrators (professionals who embed existing models into business workflows). * **Augmentation over Replacement:** Rather than eliminating jobs, Singaporean firms are re-engineering roles to make humans more productive through AI. * **Structural Stability:** The market has absorbed the technological shock by treating AI as an organizational capability rather than a substitute for labor.",2026-01-12 00:00:03.731054

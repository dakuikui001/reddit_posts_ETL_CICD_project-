The line served as a trial for a planned line that would run from Kranji to Singapore colonial town. The planned line would begin at a station near Kadang Kerbau (present-day Tekka Centre), which would provide a connection with the existing steam tram network, and run along Bukit Timah Road to Scotts Road. A 6-mile strip of land on Bukit Timah Road was even reserved to be used for the tracks. The line would then run for another 6 miles just off the road towards Kranji. There would be 5 stations, including the stations at Kadang Kerbau and Kranji. Plans to complete this line were scrapped. The similar but steam-powered [Singapore–Kranji Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore%E2%80%93Kranji_Railway) opened a decade later on 1 January 1903, originally terminating at Tank Road station, where Exit B of Fort Canning MRT station is today. The line was then rerouted to terminate at Tanjong Pagar station on 3 May 1932. Source: [*Singapore : a history of its trams, trolleybuses & buses.

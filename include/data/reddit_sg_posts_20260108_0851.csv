The activity did not involve the PA, he wrote, adding that he is now not a member of any party. >Dr Haresh said that the image was captured at a party activity where he had previously volunteered. The post, which had circulated as a screenshot online, has since been removed from his account. >He said the deletion was part of a clean up of the Instagram account, to protect the identities of individuals in the pictures as I made my account public. >CNA has contacted the PAP for comment. >The photograph has reignited online discussion about the independence of the NMP scheme, established in 1990 to bring non-partisan voices into parliament. >Similar concerns emerged last year when two NMPs – Mr Raj Joshua Thomas and Dr Syed Harun Alhabsyi – resigned in February, months before the General Election. Dr Syed Harun subsequently stood as a PAP candidate in Nee Soon GRC, and now serves as Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education and National Development. >Mr Thomas was not fielded as a candidate. >Dr Haresh would not be the only former PAP member to be appointed as an NMP. >Several past appointees have had PAP connections: businessman Calvin Cheng and former NMP Tan Su Shan both resigned from the party before their appointments, while Dr Gerard Ee was still a PAP member when he assumed the position. >Dr Haresh is among eight new faces scheduled for appointment on Jan 8, alongside Mr Mark Lee Kean Phi, CEO of Sing Lun Holdings, who returns for a second term.",2026-01-08 08:51:40.609328

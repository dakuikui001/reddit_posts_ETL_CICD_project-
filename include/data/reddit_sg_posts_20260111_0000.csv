This leaves their children and other family members who have spent a very large part of their lives here in a rather unfortunate scenario. I would think the government would want to keep them here since they are actively importing people to keep up with the TFR. I see them as members of the community that have assimilated and are very familiar with our culture. However, I understand there are more nuances since they are like contract mercenaries. Im posting this to start a discussion and also give light to a small demographic that has contributed much to the security of Singapore.

The line served as a trial for a planned line that would run from Kranji to Singapore colonial town. The planned line would begin at a station near Kadang Kerbau (present-day Tekka Centre), which would provide a connection with the existing steam tram network, and run along Bukit Timah Road to Scotts Road. A 6-mile strip of land on Bukit Timah Road was even reserved to be used for the tracks. The line would then run for another 6 miles just off the road towards Kranji. There would be 5 stations, including the Kadang Kerbau and Kranji termini. Plans to complete this line were scrapped. The similar but steam-powered Singapore–Kranji Railway opened a decade later on 1 January 1903, originally terminating at Tank Road station, where Exit B of Fort Canning MRT station is today. The line was then rerouted to terminate at Tanjong Pagar station on 3 May 1932, until its closure on 1 July 2011. Source: [*Singapore : a history of its trams, trolleybuses & buses.

Singapore: The Resilience Model Despite having a highly digitalised economy, Singapores labor market has remained stable. The key difference is a shift in hiring strategy: * **From Builders to Integrators:** Demand has shifted from Deep AI engineers (who build models) to AI Integrators (professionals who embed existing models into business workflows). * **Augmentation over Replacement:** Rather than eliminating jobs, Singaporean firms are re-engineering roles to make humans more productive through AI. * **Structural Stability:** The market has absorbed the technological shock by treating AI as an organizational capability rather than a substitute for labor.",2026-01-11 00:00:04.537554

A member stated that there were nine students punished with five demerit points for reporting the quality of food to Lianhe Zaobao. According to HCIs handbook, minor offenses earn 1 point and major ones 3-10 points. The specific consequences for accumulating 5 demerit points in the HCI High School section are outlined in their student handbook: Sabbaticals: Students with 5 or more demerit points per term are recommended to attend corrective work order during the sabbatical week. Awards and Programs: Students are generally not recommended for school-based or external awards (e.g., Model Student Award, Edusave Character Award) and may be deprived of entry into or participation in special programmes, such as overseas trips or sponsorships for competitions. Not sure what the exact offences are, probably related to them using their mobile phones to take pictures of the food when theyre not supposed to and providing it to the press...

The line served as a trial for a planned line that would run from Kranji to Singapore colonial town. The planned line would begin at a station near Kadang Kerbau (present-day Tekka Centre), which would provide a connection with the existing steam tram network, and run along Bukit Timah Road to Scotts Road. A 6-mile strip of land on Bukit Timah Road was even reserved to be used for the tracks. The line would then run for another 6 miles just off the road towards Kranji. There would be 5 stations, including the Kadang Kerbau and Kranji termini. Plans to complete this line were scrapped. The similar but steam-powered Singapore–Kranji Railway opened a decade later on 1 January 1903, originally terminating at Tank Road station, where Exit B of Fort Canning MRT station is today. The line was then rerouted to terminate at Tanjong Pagar station on 3 May 1932, until its closure on 1 July 2011. Source: [*Singapore : a history of its trams, trolleybuses & buses.

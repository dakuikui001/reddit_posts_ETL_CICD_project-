An elderly lady fainted and her glass bottle dramatically shattered in Clementi bus interchange this morning. Within moments, strangers queuing up for 166/175 sprung into action to assist her. An uncle dialled for the ambulance, a diverse group of young and old people supported the lady to a safer resting position, someone safely shoved the glass away from her, the same uncle got a wheelchair somehow, and someone ran to get the interchange service staff over. Within minutes, an ambulance arrived to provide professional care. Not to forget, a cleaner uncle came by to swiftly clear the shattered glass. I believe there are still many good people among us, willing and able to be everyday heroes. Hope this post can encourage others to share more acts of kindness!",2026-01-14 09:29:41.591992

My son enjoys using his EZ-link card to pay for food in school. It feels adult, and its faster. But if he cant see the balance on his card, how does he track his spending? Are they gonna install value checkers in every school? Does anyone know a way to top up without transiting the card to the new system? Or am I just gonna use cash because I refuse to go along with this. Edit: Appreciate those who answered. You *can* top up EZ-link cards with the SimplyGo app without converting the card. You have to add the card to the app, then the topping up mechanism is the same as the old EZ-link app. Just ignore all the prompts suggesting you convert the card to SimplyGo. You will be able to see card transaction history even without converting the card, although transaction data will be delayed a few days.

As a result, her family had to eat instant noodles as their final meal of 2025. # Food ordered at night The woman, Lim, told *Mothership* that she had placed the order at 7:41pm on Dec. 31, 2025 and received her order at 3:40am on Jan. 1, 2026. Due to the delay, the food arrived past the safe consumption period, she said, and was allegedly unrefrigerated for hours, resulting in it going bad. Lims attempts to contact foodpandas customer service to request for a refund were also rejected and she was informed that her case would be recorded as feedback. # Ordered S$73.70 worth of food, paid extra S$1.50 priority delivery fee Lim, a pandapro member, ordered four dishes and rice from Lao Huo Tang Signature at Tampines Mall. The total cost of her meal was S$73.70 - S$71.60 for the food items, S$1.99 for the delivery fee, which was waved due to her membership, a priority delivery fee of S$1.50 and a platform fee of S$0.60. When she successfully made the order at 7:41pm, the estimated delivery time was 45 to 50 minutes. However, upon checking the app subsequently for the expected arrival time, she found that it had changed to 50 to 65 minutes without explanation and there was no option to cancel the order. Food picked up hours later At around 3:20am, Lim received a notification that her order was being picked up. The delivery rider called and spoke to her, and mentioned how he had found it strange to have received an order placed at 7:41pm. When probed, the delivery rider stated that the restaurant was already closed and he had to collect the food from outside the restaurant. The food was eventually delivered at around 3:40am. Lim said she had already fallen asleep by then. She subsequently woke up and found the food at her doorstop at around 11am. As it was not consumable, she did not take pictures of her order and threw the food away. # Attempted to contact foodpanda to no avail Lim attempted to contact foodpandas customer support on multiple occasions. On Jan. 1, the request for a refund was rejected as customer support stated that Lim could not prove the food was spoilt through smell alone. On Jan. 2, Lim sent in another request, but was rejected once more. The next day she contacted customer support again, but was told that the issue would just be reported to the concerned team to help prevent this issue from occurring again. During her last interaction with customer support, Lim explicitly asked if she was speaking to a bot or a live agent. The reply was that they were a live agent. Lim said she understood that New Years Eve is a predictable peak period, but the platform should have the discretion to limit orders. She said: If a platform cannot fulfil orders within a safe timeframe, perhaps it should limit orders, suspend priority delivery options, or provide clearer warnings, instead of completing deliveries hours later with no resolution for affected customers. *Mothership* has reached out to foodpanda for comment.",2026-01-14 09:29:41.592908

Her post open to public so I hope this doesnt constitute to doxxing. Many Singaporeans dont know, but contracted Gurkhas have to leave Singapore with their family after their contract lapses. This leaves their children and other family members who have spent a very large part of their lives here in a rather unfortunate scenario. I would think the government would want to keep them here since they are actively importing people to keep up with the TFR. I see them as members of the community that have assimilated and are very familiar with our culture. However, I understand there are more nuances since they are like contract mercenaries. Im posting this to start a discussion and also give light to a small demographic that has contributed much to the security of Singapore. I honestly hope the government can relook their policies and consider letting them stay.",2026-01-14 09:29:41.593866

A member stated that there were nine students punished with five demerit points for reporting the quality of food to Lianhe Zaobao. According to HCIs handbook, minor offenses earn 1 point and major ones 3-10 points. The specific consequences for accumulating 5 demerit points in the HCI High School section are outlined in their student handbook: Sabbaticals: Students with 5 or more demerit points per term are recommended to attend corrective work order during the sabbatical week. Awards and Programs: Students are generally not recommended for school-based or external awards (e.g., Model Student Award, Edusave Character Award) and may be deprived of entry into or participation in special programmes, such as overseas trips or sponsorships for competitions. Not sure what the exact offences are, probably related to them using their mobile phones to take pictures of the food when theyre not supposed to and providing it to the press...

Fought a fire demon in live shows and illustrations. Captain V: SPFs crime fighting character who debuted when a bus smashed through a wall (kind of like Kool-Aid Man in the US) while carrying a cardboard cutout in his likeness. Also had a comic. Titoy and Morchoo: Mascots of Gardenasia, a nature resort/farmstay villa thats super ulu (a YT video by one of those walking guides showed there was only 1 bus stop serving it), mostly their kids programs. How did POSBs smiley squirrel get their number for that mascot reunion back in 2019 I wish I knew. Keep SG Clean Supermons: Essentially, kind of our take on the tsukumogami (object spirits) from Japan. Owned by the public hygiene council and apparently are friends with captain green. Mr. Mandarin Starter: Oddly only lasted one year (1986) compared to Singa, Teamy and Sharity who im pretty sure never disappeared throughout their campaigns run in the 80s. Hes also my least favourite of this bunch. Suzy: The cerebral palsy donation box girl you used to see outside ntuc before she moved online as we went cashless. Also existed in south africa. Singas family: Lasted only 1 year as the national courtesy campaign was family centric 1987. That role now falls on Families for Life and their Becky Bunny. Puffy and Poofy: Puffy is the small one, Poofy is the big one. They are the mascots of Mascot Enterprise, who make mascot costumes. SuperBun: A female bread hero whos the mascot of Food From the Heart. She likes kaya and hates food waste. Timeli: National Punctuality Drive mascot. Was revealed by Pres. Wee Kim Wee alongside his event. NTUC Cereal Mascots: I didnt know they existed until recently. Maybe I shouldnt have wished I wish we had SG ver of Tony the Tiger",2026-01-14 09:29:41.594119

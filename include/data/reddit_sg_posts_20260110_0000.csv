Her post open to public so I hope this doesnt constitute to doxxing. Many Singaporeans dont know, but contracted Gurkhas have to leave Singapore with their family after their contract lapses. This leaves their children and other family members who have spent a very large part of their lives here in a rather unfortunate scenario. I would think the government would want to keep them here since they are actively importing people to keep up with the TFR. I see them as members of the community that have assimilated and are very familiar with our culture. However, I understand there are more nuances since they are like contract mercenaries. Im posting this to start a discussion and also give light to a small demographic that has contributed much to the security of Singapore. I honestly hope the government can relook their policies and consider letting them stay.",2026-01-10 00:00:04.270066

The specific consequences for accumulating 5 demerit points in the HCI High School section are outlined in their student handbook: Sabbaticals: Students with 5 or more demerit points per term are recommended to attend corrective work order during the sabbatical week. Awards and Programs: Students are generally not recommended for school-based or external awards (e.g., Model Student Award, Edusave Character Award) and may be deprived of entry into or participation in special programmes, such as overseas trips or sponsorships for competitions. Not sure what the exact offences are, probably related to them using their mobile phones to take pictures of the food when theyre not supposed to and providing it to the press...

The line served as a trial for a planned line that would run from Kranji to Singapore colonial town. The planned line would begin at a station near Kadang Kerbau (present-day Tekka Centre), which would provide a connection with the existing steam tram network, and run along Bukit Timah Road to Scotts Road. A 6-mile strip of land on Bukit Timah Road was even reserved to be used for the tracks. The line would then run for another 6 miles just off the road towards Kranji. There would be 5 stations, including the Kadang Kerbau and Kranji termini. Plans to complete this line were scrapped. The similar but steam-powered Singapore–Kranji Railway opened a decade later on 1 January 1903, originally terminating at Tank Road station, where Exit B of Fort Canning MRT station is today. The line was then rerouted to terminate at Tanjong Pagar station on 3 May 1932, until its closure on 1 July 2011. Source: [*Singapore : a history of its trams, trolleybuses & buses.

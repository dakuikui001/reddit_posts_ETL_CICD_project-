My son enjoys using his EZ-link card to pay for food in school. It feels adult, and its faster. But if he cant see the balance on his card, how does he track his spending? Are they gonna install value checkers in every school? Does anyone know a way to top up without transiting the card to the new system? Or am I just gonna use cash because I refuse to go along with this. Edit: Appreciate those who answered. You *can* top up EZ-link cards with the SimplyGo app without converting the card. You have to add the card to the app, then the topping up mechanism is the same as the old EZ-link app. Just ignore all the prompts suggesting you convert the card to SimplyGo.

As a result, her family had to eat instant noodles as their final meal of 2025. # Food ordered at night The woman, Lim, told *Mothership* that she had placed the order at 7:41pm on Dec. 31, 2025 and received her order at 3:40am on Jan. 1, 2026. Due to the delay, the food arrived past the safe consumption period, she said, and was allegedly unrefrigerated for hours, resulting in it going bad. Lims attempts to contact foodpandas customer service to request for a refund were also rejected and she was informed that her case would be recorded as feedback. # Ordered S$73.70 worth of food, paid extra S$1.50 priority delivery fee Lim, a pandapro member, ordered four dishes and rice from Lao Huo Tang Signature at Tampines Mall. The total cost of her meal was S$73.70 - S$71.60 for the food items, S$1.99 for the delivery fee, which was waved due to her membership, a priority delivery fee of S$1.50 and a platform fee of S$0.60. When she successfully made the order at 7:41pm, the estimated delivery time was 45 to 50 minutes. However, upon checking the app subsequently for the expected arrival time, she found that it had changed to 50 to 65 minutes without explanation and there was no option to cancel the order. Food picked up hours later At around 3:20am, Lim received a notification that her order was being picked up. The delivery rider called and spoke to her, and mentioned how he had found it strange to have received an order placed at 7:41pm. When probed, the delivery rider stated that the restaurant was already closed and he had to collect the food from outside the restaurant. The food was eventually delivered at around 3:40am. Lim said she had already fallen asleep by then. She subsequently woke up and found the food at her doorstop at around 11am. As it was not consumable, she did not take pictures of her order and threw the food away. # Attempted to contact foodpanda to no avail Lim attempted to contact foodpandas customer support on multiple occasions. On Jan. 1, the request for a refund was rejected as customer support stated that Lim could not prove the food was spoilt through smell alone. On Jan. 2, Lim sent in another request, but was rejected once more. The next day she contacted customer support again, but was told that the issue would just be reported to the concerned team to help prevent this issue from occurring again. During her last interaction with customer support, Lim explicitly asked if she was speaking to a bot or a live agent. The reply was that they were a live agent. Lim said she understood that New Years Eve is a predictable peak period, but the platform should have the discretion to limit orders. She said: If a platform cannot fulfil orders within a safe timeframe, perhaps it should limit orders, suspend priority delivery options, or provide clearer warnings, instead of completing deliveries hours later with no resolution for affected customers. *Mothership* has reached out to foodpanda for comment.",2026-01-15 00:00:03.318734

Ambulance came n recommended going to hospital. So the A&E doc says to stay in hospital KTPH for investigation and monitoring given her age, almost 70. So at that point, we were asked which ward. As she has an IP plan NTUC Income plan B, and the amounts shown to us was that after insurance, and medisave of 2k, we just needed a cash guarantee of $100+ if we went for B1.
